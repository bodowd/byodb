I think that it helps to have gone through some material that explains the
background of things like B-Trees before this book.
Perhaps some lectures like CS-186 from Berkeley.

The book doesn't explain a whole lot of how these are working. I also think that
in some places explanations of the code are a bit difficult to understand.
